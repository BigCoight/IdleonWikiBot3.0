{{dialogue/row|Hi want to trade stuff? I have tons of cool things oak logs bleach logs maple logs you name it!}}
{{dialogue/row|You want a stamp? I have one of those!!! Me and my siblings all nabbed one from our Dad before we left home! He wanted to teach us economics and business... boring! We just want to adventure!}}
{{dialogue/row|Neato axe! But I can't give you the stamp you're inventory is full!}}
{{dialogue/row|Deal! This is gonna bump up my choppin power so much I bet I'll finally be able to fully chop down this tree!}}
{{dialogue/row|Hmm this tree is tough! I think I need something else...}}
{{dialogue/row|Clear up 1 space for the stamp!}}
{{dialogue/row|Wow my Choppin Efficiency is mega huge now! This tree wont stand a chance! Come on back later I'll surely have this tree chopped down to the roots by then! <br> Return at Choppin Lv. 7}}
{{dialogue/row|Well I've only got one stamp left but I'm holding onto it! Buuuut since you got my previous stamps I don't really need this storage chest for anything.}}
{{dialogue/row|You're out of inventory. Clear up 1 space and come back!}}
{{dialogue/row|Thats uh quite a few less than a billion. But that Quest Notifier was right I'll still accept! Here's the storage chest it's super OP for a big time adventurer like you!}}
