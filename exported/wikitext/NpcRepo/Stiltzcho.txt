{{dialogue/row|text=So what is needed then?           <br> ...someone stole tha town Gem? This is very troubling indeed! I am glad you were sent to me I believe I may be of help.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=I have heard talk of a beeg golem passing through. I have heard many story of it they say tha golem was over 400 pixels tall and was carrying a big sword with a gem on it!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=I can investigate further myself but I need you to clear a path for me by defeating some of these slimes.}}

{{dialogue/row|text=Very niiice now lets see what I can find around here...}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Aha! Just as I suspected there is a strange absense of slimes in this area! Thats a clear sign that tha Golem has been this way...}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Humm but which way did he go? He was surely too big to fit in tha tree so he must have gone left.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=There must be some sort of clue there. I'll wait here while you go searching that way I can be well rested to investigate your find! <br> QUEST:Kill Baby Boa Snakes until you find a clue|quest=No Stone Unturned}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Please clear up 2 inventory space so I can give you some stuff I made while you were gone!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Aha! These strange rocks must be pieces of tha golem!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Now then you found those to the left of here... so that must mean the golem moved left of here! Oh yeh it's all coming together...}}
{{dialogue/row|text=One last thing before I write up a report. It has been so long since I got to play a joke on Scripticas and I want you to help me pull another one on him!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Before I left I kept putting carrots everywhere he went. I put one on his desk at his front door I even put carrots in his dinner! Tha last one didn't work though because he was eating carrot cake that night.}}

{{dialogue/row|text=Also about the prank... I kind of messed up and made a nightmare inducing abomination which isn't tha joke I was going for. You can just keep it instead okey?}}

{{dialogue/row|text=I am big sorry to have wasted your time like this I guess the thief moved o--- wait a minute...}}
{{dialogue/row|text=I'M THE THIEF!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Haha I guess it is that I just get easily sidetrack and lose focus often and instead of investigating myself for the problem I tried to blame someone else!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=I think I will take some time alone having rest when it is needed is NEVER a waste of time even for a leaf like me!}}
