{{dialogue/row|text=Ah... welcome true gamer. You have come back here in the hopes of a secret a wise decision indeed!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=I haven't much to say personally... instead I will let the Game's Creator Lavaflame2 speak to you through me: <br> 'Yoo wuddup gamer happy to see you here most people are too dumbo maximus to find this little easter egg!'}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Find the Secretstone|quest=The Few, the Proud}}
{{dialogue/row|text='Yo wtf? You figured it out?? Nice! Here take your reward of absolutely nothing! <br> Although I don't want to leave you empty handed... how about this I'll mark this quest as completed in your Codex after the tutorial as proof that you're a true gamer!'}}
{{dialogue/row|text='Oh and um one more thing yea? I figure you'll wanna write this down 3-6-3-9-0-blue. Hahaha aight Imma head out see ya.' <br> ... ouch that gave me a headache I still don't get why the game developer can't just talk to his own gamers directly?}}
