{{dialogue/row|Hey there what's your name? ...wait what's my name? What even am I? Am I alive?? Am I dead?? WHAT IS THIS PLACE???}}
{{dialogue/row|How do I even breath?? Do I have lungs? Do I even need to breath since I'm basically made of air?}}
{{dialogue/row|Oh no what if the game gets uninstalled before I'm even created? I'll be stuck like this forever and ever!}}
{{dialogue/row|And what are all those other spaces to my right are there going to be more things just like me later on?}}
{{dialogue/row|What if the player gets bored before making them? Will they suffer for all eternity forced to contemplate the faint glow of their existance?}}
{{dialogue/row|Even worse what if the player is an avid reader? Will they continue postponing my creation just to keep reading my frightened ramblings?}}
{{dialogue/row|What did I even do to deserve this? Did I cheat at a mobile game in a past life or even worse did I make mobile games in a past life?}}
{{dialogue/row|And why am I so... undefined? It's like im made up of a bunch of little squares ... I'd say this is some sort of cube world if this game were more abandoned}}
{{dialogue/row|You're uh... awfully slow at choosing a name! No rush or anything it's not like im having an existential crisis here.}}
{{dialogue/row|Tell you what if you give me a name I'll give you a cool ring! I'm not even sure what a ring is or why I have one in the first place or how to even give it to you...}}
{{dialogue/row|So is that a deal? Type a name in and create me if you agree!}}
