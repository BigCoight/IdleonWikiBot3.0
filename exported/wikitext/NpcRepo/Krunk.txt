|notes=[[Krunk]] is found in [[Worlds#M2 - Freefall Caverns|Freefall Caverns]], the second zone of the mines, located at the bottom of the area.

Finishing his questline will unlock a shortcut to the gold ore within [[Worlds#M2 - Freefall Caverns|Freefall Caverns]], but only for characters that have completed the questline.

You must complete all three of his quests and talk to him after reaching [[Mining]] Level 25 in order to receive the {{CraftReq|Krunk Token}}, which falls on the ground. He does say Level 33 at first but then changes his mind and gives it to you early.{{Sources/datarow|Item=Krunk Token

{{dialogue/row|text=If only I could achieve such form. Hey human could you get me some ingredients? I've got an idea. <br> QUEST:Get Krunk some things that will probably not explode when mixed.|quest=A Plot to be Perfect}}
{{dialogue/row|text=You've got a full inventory clear some space so I can give you the byproduct of my failed creation!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Interesting the viscosity of the mana potion prevented it from adhering to the smooth surface of the iron sample instead rendering it edible!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=If I am to achieve total substantiative infusion I'll have to use more sophisticated words so I seem smart enough to bend reality to do my bidding! Fetcheth unto me thine most precious of materials! <br> QUEST:He want's shiny things.|quest=The Scientific Method, According to a Rock}}
{{dialogue/row|text=You've got a full inventory clear some space so I can give you the byproduct of my failed creation!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=How curious the gilded particles of those precious metals broke down the structural integrity of the statue without mitigating its bonus giving qualities!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=However I am no closer to turning myself into diamond. My scholarly vocabulary has not aided the inventive process thus far so perhaps I must take a step back and be more simple minded...}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Well Bobby today sure is a fine day for some construction work I tell you hwat! Nothing beats the satisfaction of creating something with your own two hands 'specially something that also serves a useful purpose! <br> QUEST:Gather some construction materials for Hank... I mean Krunk.|quest=King of the Cavern}}
{{dialogue/row|text=There we have it now that's a sturdy bridge if ever I've seen one! ...well I wasn't expecting roleplaying as a hard-working propane salesman to help with my scientific pursuits! And it didnt! I guess I should just give up I have no other ideas.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Aha I've got an idea! Quick go buy 500000 gems from the Gem Store I can use them to alter the... <br> what's that? You'd uninstall if that was the actual quest? Alright give me a moment to think of an alternate plan... <br> Return at Mining Level 33}}
{{dialogue/row|text=You've come at the right time player! I have devised the perfect strategy to rid me of this worthless rock body!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=I need you to... <br> Hang on I'm getting a call from the game developer LavaFlame2... Hey how are you? ... Oh is that so? You haven't coded my final quest yet and you need me to stall them? I see sure I'll let them know.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Sorry human but I actually need you to give me a moment to finalize my strategy. You know crunch the numbers one last time make sure I didn't forget to carry the two and all that. <br> Return at Mining Lv.20}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Hold up human you're acting a bit over eager for my final quest! Look perfect science like this is no trifling thing... a 5 month wait since 'The Kablamo' happened back in November of last year isn't all that long considering the sophisticaion at hand!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=You can have my token early if it means you'll get off my back for a while but do return when I am prepared for my final plan!}}
