|notes=The [[Obol Altar]] appears in both [[Worlds#F2 - Encroaching Forest Villas|Encroaching Forest Villas]] and [[Worlds#D0 - YumYum Grotto|YumYum Grotto]].

The Obol Altar offers three tabs for Obols and one summary page. In the first tab, Obols only affect the current character and slots are unlocked based on the level of the specific character. In the second tab, Obols affect all characters and slots are unlocked based on the total level of all characters you have. In the third tab, you can reroll obol stats, combine obols and scrap obols to turn them into fragments. And finally, in the fourth tab you can see the total bonuses from all your equipped obols.

To access the Obol Altar, one must defeat Amarok at least once and complete the quest 'Bad Kitty, get off that altar!' on any character. The altar will then become available to all the remaining characters of that account.
