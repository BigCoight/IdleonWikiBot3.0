|notes=The [[Picnic Stowaway]] is found in [[Worlds#G3 - Froggy Fields|Froggy Fields]], the second zone of Grasslands, located in the bottom left of the area.

After completing his first 3 quests, his following quests will be part of a quest chain that is limited by a daily reset. You can do the full daily questline once per character per reset, but whether you complete the full questline or not it will start over at the first quest in the chain (The Most Important Meal of the Day) after your daily reset.

The Picnic Stowaway daily questline is the source of the [[Peanut]] Recipe, and completing the third quest in the chain is a possible daily [[Tasks#Blunder Hills|Task]]. 

Completing the full daily questline in a single day awards you one {{CraftReq|Picnic Token}}. In order to obtain the [[King of Food]] trophy, you must complete the full daily questline 30 times.
