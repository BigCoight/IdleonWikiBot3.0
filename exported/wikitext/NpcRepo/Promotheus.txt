{{dialogue/row|text=Hello there adventurer! Uh... I know my bulging sack is quite the eyegrabber but my face is down here!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=I am the mighty Promotheus Giver of Class Promotions! I was initially going to fill in for Atlas but after I saw what Kratos did to him I decided to lay low in a more obscure game for a while!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Hang on are you actually ready for a promotion? Come talk to me once you're level 10.|quest=I'm Ready, Promotion!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Great now listen carefully.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=First the WARRIOR class. They are close ranged single target fighters who won't get knocked down easy and their main stat their STR makes them great at Mining.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Next the ARCHER class. They'll rapidly pick off weaker enemies from a distance and their main stat AGI makes them great at Smithing.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Lastly the MAGE class. They'll zap freeze burn or even poison their enemies to death and their main stat WIS makes them great at Chopping.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Oh one more thing...}}
{{dialogue/row|text=This may sound strange but this will not be your only character!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=You will create LOTS of characters so you'll get to play EVERY class! Just pick the class which you want to main first.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=|quest=Three Right Answers}}
{{dialogue/row|text=That's a great choice! I'm curious to see which class you pick on your next character... you'll see what I mean!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Well then... now that we've gotten to know each other a bit how about I tell you some game lore?}}
{{dialogue/row|text=HAH! Just kidding a game like this doesn't have any lore! <br> ...so anyway the loremasters of this game speak of an ancient land far above these lazy ol' Blunder Hills.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=In this crazy place there are weird sub mechanics and overly complicated gameplay systems the likes of which we simple World 1 NPC's could never comprehend.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=The monsters here are even crazier many are references to something called 'pop culture' which I assume is some sort of Bubble Religion in their land.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=I even saw one of these horrors with my own eyes... but I don't want to scare you so please return once I can trust that you wont be frightened... <br> Return at Lv. 40}}
{{dialogue/row|text=It was a giant house with... legs or something. I think it only shows up at the top of each hour but I know it exists! Please go prove I'm not crazy. <br> QUEST:Find the house monster in the Birch Grove.|quest=Slovakian Scare}}
{{dialogue/row|text=You need 1 more inventory space. Make some room and come back!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Wait you actually found it? Huh guess I won't be selling many of my alien merchandise anymore... you can take some if youd like!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=What did you say it was again a Baby Yogurt? ... a Baboon Yolo? <br> Ohhh a Baba Yaga of course! Yea I've never heard of that in my life. I wonder what it drops? <br> QUEST:Me too go kill it and see what loot you get!|quest=The Witcher, but not Really}}
{{dialogue/row|text=You need 1 more inventory space. Make some room and come back!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Did you get anything good? I was talking to the loremasters while you were away and they tell me this 'Baba Yaga' monster has a chance to drop a pet egg!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=They said the egg is used for future content so if you ever find it you should probably hold onto it!}}
