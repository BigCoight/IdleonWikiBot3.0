{{dialogue/row|text=Anyway... now that I'm up you want a Class Advancement? You definitely look like you could use one! <br> ...err that came out wrong sorry! What I meant to say is that you're a noob who needs a better class! Let me tell you how it works.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Class Advancements are basically new classes. <br> However this will NOT REPLACE your current class. You will continue to get Talent Points for your current Talents.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=So yea you'll get a brand new set of 15 talents! These talents are separate from your old ones so every time you level up you'll get Talent Points to spend on these new talents while also getting Talent Points for the old talents.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Quick recap: <br> Class Advancements give you another tab of Talents to upgrade which uses a different set of Talent Points than your current Tabs. <br> Go ahead and talk to me again and I'll let you choose your class advancement!}}
