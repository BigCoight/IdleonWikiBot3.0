{{dialogue/row|text=As it happens I was just browsing page 6 infinity 7 of my map here... and I noticed some strange markings I could have sworn weren't there before!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Next to the 1st mark I see frogs the 2nd mark I believe is located in a Doctors office and the 3rd is somewhere between the Grandioso Canyon and here. <br> QUEST:Find the 3 invisible platforms hidden throughout the game.|quest=Platforms in Disguise, Platsformers!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Please my good man show some respect! My prizes for completing the quest are well worth keeping you are very mistaken to not have 2 open inventory spaces!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=My my so these marks were indeed phased in from an alternate universe? Perhaps a higher order world will shed light on their existence but whatever they may be they haven't much to do with me.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=You see I seek the whereabouts of the Maestro Blobulyte... it's a Journeyman thing. Anywho I am about ready to Job Advance and I am certain Lavaflame2 put in a secret subclass NPC somewhere! <br> QUEST:Collect materials maybe the blobulyte left some fingerprints on one?|quest=Findin' Fingerprints}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Please my good man show some respect! My prizes for completing the quest are well worth keeping you are very mistaken to not have 3 open inventory spaces!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Good finds old sport! Now then lets see... <br> Well quite frankly there isn't so much as a trace of Blob on any of these! Wherever that Blobulyte is they haven't been around these three monsters in a long time...}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Well we've got ourselves a game of hide and seek! Why don't you come back later once I've found them? <br> Return at Class Lv.70}}

{{dialogue/row|text=Hahaha! I concur old sport! However we mustn't get too down. As a matter of fact I take my hat off to the darn thing it's hiding skills are exquisite! I so suppose I'll be staying a lowly Journeyman for now.}}
{{dialogue/row|text=One day... one day I'll find them! I dare say old sport they can't hide forever! After all sooner or later someone will update the Wiki with a full walkthrough on how to find them!}}
{{dialogue/row|text=... but I think we've done our part lets change course here. How about a simple maths puzzle? Get our minds off of that devious blobulyte what do you think?}}
{{dialogue/row|text=Right-o! Here's the puzzle: <br> Square the number of letters in your character's name. For example 'Koala2' would be 6x6=  36. Kill sand giants until there are exactly 'that' many items on the ground and talk to me! If you get it wrong I'll remove ALL items in the map! <br> QUEST:Do the puzzle!|quest=Puzzles and Math, a Winning Combination!}}
